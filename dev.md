Amid the wave of technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain stand out as two of the most disruptive innovations. AI delivers powerful computing and data analysis capabilities, while blockchain is known for its decentralization, security, and transparency. However, centralized AI computing resources, data privacy risks, and inefficiencies in smart contracts hinder their deep integration.

AI-Chain was born from a profound understanding of these challenges. Our founding team consists of blockchain developers, AI researchers, and Web3 ecosystem builders, all committed to creating a decentralized AI computing network, ensuring AI computations run securely, trustworthily, and transparently on a global scale.
